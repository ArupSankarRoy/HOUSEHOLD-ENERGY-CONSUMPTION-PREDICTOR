## Energy Consumption Prediction Flask Application
Overview:
The Energy Consumption Prediction Flask Application is a user-friendly machine learning web application designed to accurately predict individual household energy consumption with an impressive 99% accuracy. The application employs a robust Huber Regressor to handle the presence of outliers in the dataset, ensuring reliable and precise predictions.

## Key Features:
# Huber Regressor for Robust Prediction:

The application utilizes the Huber Regressor, a resilient regression model capable of handling datasets with a significant number of outliers. This ensures the model's stability and accuracy even in the presence of anomalous data points.
Flask for Web Framework:

Flask, a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python, serves as the backbone of the application. Its simplicity and ease of use make it an excellent choice for building web applications.
# User-Friendly UI with HTML and CSS:

The user interface (UI) is crafted using HTML and CSS to provide an intuitive and visually appealing experience. The design prioritizes user-friendliness, making it easy for users to input data and obtain energy consumption predictions.
# High Accuracy:

The machine learning model achieves an exceptional 99% accuracy in predicting household energy consumption. This accuracy is a result of careful model selection and robust handling of outliers.
## Optimization Suggestions:

# Model Fine-Tuning:

Continuously fine-tune the Huber Regressor model by exploring hyperparameter tuning and experimenting with different algorithms. This can further enhance prediction accuracy.
# Data Preprocessing:

Ensure thorough data preprocessing to handle missing values, scale features appropriately, and address any data quality issues. Well-preprocessed data contributes to better model performance.
# Scalability Considerations:

Evaluate the application's scalability to handle a growing user base. Consider implementing features such as model caching or deploying the application on a scalable cloud infrastructure if usage increases significantly.
# Responsive Design:

Enhance the UI with responsive design principles to ensure a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes. This includes optimizing layouts and styles for both desktop and mobile users.
# User Feedback Mechanism:

Implement a user feedback mechanism to collect input from users regarding the predictions. This feedback can be valuable for continuous improvement of the model and the application.
By combining a robust model with an intuitive user interface, the Energy Consumption Prediction Flask Application provides users with a powerful tool for accurately estimating household energy consumption while maintaining a delightful user experience.
